A simple github repo search by org app! (That's a mouthful, I know ðŸ˜„)

### Notes

This app was made by utilizing Octokit as SDK for Github API

Bootstrapped by `create-react-app`

Utilized `react-hook-form`, `react-query`, and `material-ui`

Org and repo searching is done via API calls, but filtering by open issues are done in the client.
